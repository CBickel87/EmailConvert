# EmailConvert

Within Outlook email --> The "To: field" copied and pasted into Convert2Email and the pgoram would 
covert full names into email address by querying Active Directory.

## Motivation

I wrote this for a coworker. She described her frustration of trying to gather a large number of user email addresses out of 
the "To: field" from an email she sent previously. In Outlook 2007, she was only given the "lastname, firstname" of 
all receipients. This is now obsolete since newer versions of Outlook have resolved this issue. Had to leave the names and emails out
of the image for privacy purposes.
